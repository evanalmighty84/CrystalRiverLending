We have answers.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;What Services Does CrystalRiver Lending, LLC<\/strong> <strong>Offer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We offer a range of services tailored to meet your real estate investment needs. Our offerings include Fix &amp; Flip, Buy &amp; Hold, Refinance, Commercial, New Construction and Private Money Loans. We also provide Proof of Funds Letters, Collateral DNA Reports, Debt Stack Reports and have high equity off market property leads available, so you are not competing with other investors in your area<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What are the benefits of private money lending?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits include quicker access to capital, flexibility in loan terms, no minimum credit score requirements, and the ability to secure financing for properties that may not meet traditional lending criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Are you a Lender or a Broker and are there fees or commissions involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are a lender and a broker. If for any reason we can\u2019t provide the funding you need, then we have a large network of other lenders we work closely with and we can broker the funds to you. We like providing options to the investors we work with. So, you can have the best rates and the quickest closings available to you. If you\u2019re in need of a 100% funding we also have split equity opportunities available to provide you up to a 100% funding for your purchase, rehab and closing costs. Regardless of the loan type there is always a 3% Broker fee, which is standard in the industry.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. How do you decide the amount to lend?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is based on the Asset you have under contract. Generally, we lend up to 90% of the purchase price and 100% of the rehab cost. Ask us how you can get up to a 100%<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. I need 100% financing. Can you do that?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yes, when joint venturing with us then we can indeed provide up to a 100% financing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. What Does True 100% Funding Mean?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We will lend up to 100% towards your purchase, rehab, and closing costs up to 70% of the ARV., when a joint venture is established between CrystalRiver Lending, LLC and the borrowe<\/strong>r.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. How long does it take to close a transaction from start to finish?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About 14 days after we receive all required documentation but receiving all documentation can take three to four weeks. The key factor is the amount of time it takes you and your team to supply all the supporting documentation. We can do our part in roughly 14 business days, but Investors seeking funding rarely get us the documents quickly enough and complete enough to meet that. Aim for 30 days whenever you can. Remember: If the amount of time needed to close is a factor, you probably have competition, and competition rarely translates into a good deal. Bring your deal in to discuss it with us.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8.What Does FHA Cap Mean?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The FHA Cap represents the maximum loan amount&nbsp;in the county the investment property is located in. To find the FHA Cap in the county where the investment property is located click on the link below:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/entp.hud.gov\/idapp\/html\/hicostlook.cfm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FHA Mortgage Limits (hud.gov)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9.What Does ARV Mean?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ARV stands for After-Repair Value. It is the estimated value of a property after completed renovations.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10.What Does Asset Based Lending Mean?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asset-based lending is a loan where the lending decision is primarily based on the value of the real estate property under contract, rather than the credit worthiness of the borrower. While a borrower\u2019s ability to pay the loan is considered, the approval decision and loan to value rests primarily upon the value of the property.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. What are your Loan Terms?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. CrystalRiver Lending, LLC has lending options from $30,000 up to the FHA Cap in the county where the property is located and can provide additional funding solutions based on the property you have under contract and type of loan needed.<br>2. Rates start at 7% annualized interest with an origination fee from 0-3%, and no prepayment penalties. (Rates are based on credit score but credit score does NOT determine loan approval.)<br>3. Loan Term: 6 Months to 2 Years for a fix &amp; flip. 30 Years for a buy &amp; hold or refinance.<br>4. One loan approved per applicant until proven track record.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12.\u00a0Do I need an appraisal and how much will it cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CrystalRiver Lending, LLC requires an appraisal before closing. Appraisal costs vary from a minimum of $400 to approximately $700 depending on property location.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13. Is A Licensed &amp; Bonded Contractor bid required?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>in most cases, requires a licensed and insured itemized contractor bid before we can process the loan.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14. Is my information kept confidential?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ABSOLUTELY 100%! Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Any information you provide is completely confidential! If you want to deal with a reliable, reputable company who will treat you with professionalism, understanding, and respect \u2013 YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Questions?
