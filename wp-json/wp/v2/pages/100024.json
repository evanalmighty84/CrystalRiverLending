The rule of thumb is it\u2019s much easier to shop for cash when you have a deal in hand and under contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because as long as that property is not under contract, it\u2019s up for grabs by anyone and everyone and no lender will spend time and resources on a property that can be snatched out from under the borrower at any moment\u2019s notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting the house under contract is an easy enough, 4-Step process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Step 1:<\/strong>Prospect and Review Potential Properties<\/li><li><strong>Step 2:<\/strong>Write Offers<\/li><li><strong>Step 3:<\/strong>Get Offer Accepted by Seller<\/li><li><strong>Step 4:<\/strong>Put Earnest Money in Escrow to complete the contract.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once these 4 Steps are completed, you have a fully executed Purchase and Sale Agreement, the property is under contract, and you are ready to shop for cash.

Depending on how fast you submit the loan package items, you can have your loan in several days to several weeks. It can take one to three months to secure a loan with traditional financing.<\/li><li><strong>It Looks at Collateral, Not You:<\/strong>&nbsp;Private money lenders are not interested in credit score. They are interested in how much value they see in the property since the property is the asset that is backing the loan.<\/li><li><strong>It\u2019s Everywhere:<\/strong>&nbsp;Private money lenders are often people who have funds parked in lower-yielding financial vehicles like CDs, stocks, or IRAs and are looking for newer ways to maximize their funds in higher yielding conduits, like lending on real estate.<\/li><li><strong>It\u2019s Creative:&nbsp;<\/strong>With Private money, you can get funding on great deals that banks would normally shun. Promising investment properties that need repairs, make them unsuitable for most banks, but perfect for most Private money lenders.<\/li><li><strong>It\u2019s Flexible:<\/strong>&nbsp;Private money lenders don\u2019t have the same strictly enforced guidelines to follow for their loan applications, so they are more willing to help creatively structure loans that work for the project.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a Private Money Lender, like CrystalRiver Lending, LLC in your court gives you confidence to put properties under contract. As long as you find the no-brainer deal that fits our guidelines, do the proper due-diligence, and turn in an application. you can be rest-assured that the deal will be funded!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of every successful fix and flip is finding the&nbsp;right&nbsp;real estate property.&nbsp; That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this easy, 5-point guide to help you find the \u201csweet spot\u201d deal, which can give you the best chance at making money in real estate, while safeguarding your investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At CrystalRiver Lending, LLC we are only interested in funding projects that will give you the best opportunity at realizing success. Therefore, our criteria is centered around these 5 points:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.rfsitebuilder.com\/app\/uploads\/sites\/521525\/2024\/03\/newloadcriteria1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1495\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Homes above the FHA cap are statistically more likely to experience drastic fluctuations in value and can be more susceptible to local and overall market depreciation. Homes in the 5-point realm tend to be more resilient to these influences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WHY 1-4 UNITS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important. When you invest within these parameters, you can attract a larger segment of the market, including FHA buyers. This increases your ability to appeal to more people in more demographics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WHY PRICE YOUR HOME AT OR BELOW FHA REQUIREMENTS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FHA loans bring home ownership into reach for first-time home buyers who might have a hard time getting approved with conventional lenders. This increases your ability to sell your property faster and broadens your ability to attract more potential buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WHY A SMALLER HOME WITH NO MORE THAN 5 BEDROOMS AND 3 BATHS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Millennials and Boomers are the two segments expected to dominate the market in the next five years. Both of these segments are looking at smaller homes: Millennials because they\u2019re just starting out; Boomers because they\u2019re downsizing. Candace Taylor of&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em>&nbsp;wrote, \u201cThese days, buyers of all ages eschew the large, ornate houses\u2026 in favor of smaller, more modern-looking alternatives.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>WHY LESS THAN 2 ACRE?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Boomers and Millennials are looking for less upkeep: Boomers because they\u2019re getting older and Millennials because they\u2019re just starting out. More acreage also means more expense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Types of Deals CrystalRiver Lending, LLC<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.rfsitebuilder.com\/app\/uploads\/sites\/522567\/2024\/06\/New-loan-Programs-1024x600.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-100062\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Loan Terms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.
